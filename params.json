For each result, you need to do something if there's some deeply nested data present:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fatherFirstNames = [];\r\n\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < families.length; i ++) {\r\n  var first = families[i].father.info.name.first;\r\n\r\n  if (first) {\r\n    fatherFirstNames.push(first);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'family.father.info.name.first')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhoops! You shot yourself in the foot. You got a `TypeError` because you had no guarantee that the family had a father, or that the father had info present, or that his name was returned! You fix it by writing this monstrosity:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fartherFirstNames = [];\r\n\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < families.length; i++) {\r\n  var father = families[i].father;\r\n\r\n  if (father && father.info && father.info.name && father.info.name.first) {\r\n    fatherFirstNames.push(father.info.name.first);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, you could use SteelToe and write this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fatherFirstNames = [];\r\n\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < families.length; i++) {\r\n  var family = SteelToe(families[i]),\r\n      name = family.walk('father.info.name.first');\r\n\r\n  if (name) {\r\n    fatherFirstNames.push(name);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfatherFirstNames; // [\"Hank\", \"Dale\", \"Bill\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nSteelToe is a tiny JavaScript function that makes it safe to traipse about objects without worrying about keys may or may not exist, and if its safe to try and look inside of them. There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n### Method #1\r\n```javascript\r\nvar object = { info: { name: { first: 'Jonathan', last: 'Clem' } } }\r\n\r\nobject = SteelToe(object);\r\nobject('info')('name')('last')();      // 'Clem'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Method #2\r\n```javascript\r\nvar object = { info: { name: { first: 'Jonathan', last: 'Clem' } } }\r\n\r\nobject = SteelToe(object);\r\nobject.walk('info.name.last');      // 'Clem'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The End\r\n\r\nSteelToe was made when a coworker of mine said that he wished someone would write a JavaScript library that would allow him to traverse objects without shooting himself in the foot, and that the library was called SteelToe.","name":"SteelToe","tagline":"Don't shoot yourself in the foot traversing objects."}
